I currently live in San Francisco and work at [Industrial Light & Magic](https://www.ilm.com/). I grew up in Northern Virginia and the Bay Area and previously studied at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

I'm mostly focused on platform engineering, distributed systems, and systems programming at the moment, but some of my other technical interests include computer graphics, backend web development and MLOps.
