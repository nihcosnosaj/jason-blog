Hello! I'm Jason.

I currently live in San Francisco and work at [Industrial Light & Magic](https://www.ilm.com/). I grew up in Northern Virginia and the Bay Area and previously studied at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

I'm a systems-focused engineer who really enjoys understanding and building the invisible foundations that make this complex software/AI/ML ecosystem possible. 

Currently, I'm mostly focused on platform & infrastructure engineering, distributed systems, and low-level systems programming at the moment, but some of my other technical interests include computer graphics, full-stack web development and MLOps. There's probably more I could list. I find it immensely enjoyable to learn how stuff works and go down rabbit holes to pick up whatever’s needed to build what I’m excited about, so this list grows quite frequently.

Outside of the technical stuff, I enjoy:
- running along the Embarcadero or at Golden Gate Park
- surfing at Ocean Beach 
- watching airplanes at SFO
- speaking Italian
- walking around San Francisco
