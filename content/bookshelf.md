While I've read quite a lot over the years, I've done a lousy job of keeping track of what I read as well as what I thought about it. This is an attempt to remedy that. 

This list isn't meant to be purely novels, but really anything from whitepapers on a technical topic to an art book I read in a waiting room somewhere. I aim to include one to two sentences on it, but may not get around to it for every single entry.
